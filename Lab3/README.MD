Laboratory work #3: CALCULATING INTEGRALS

- In this work we will use 3 methods to calculate the integrals:
1) Rectangle Method
2) Trapezes Method
3) Simpson Method

- RECTANGELS METHOD
This method based on simple approximation of itegrals related with rectangles (pic.1)

- TRAPEZES METHOD
This method based on trapeze-approximation of function (pic.2)

- SIMPSON METHOD
This method based on parabola-approximation of function (pic.3) and simple formula for calculation paraboloic integrals very precisely
